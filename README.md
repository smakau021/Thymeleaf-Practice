# Thymeleaf-Practice
  Here’s a small Thymeleaf app that has a trivial domain model and It consists of only 3 classes:      a ToyRobot class — our domain model,html and      the application itself which instantiates, configures and exercises the templating engine using a simple String as a template.
I have created a template file for the spike and configured the templating engine to process that template file.The template file consists of HTML text that you can change and play around it if you like, or just plain text.
